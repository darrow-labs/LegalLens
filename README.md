Abstract:
In this study, we focus on two main tasks, the
first for detecting legal violations within unstructured textual data, and the second for associating these violations with potentially affected individuals. We constructed two datasets
using Large Language Models (LLMs) which
were subsequently validated by domain expert
annotators. Both tasks were designed specifically for the context of class-action cases. The
experimental design incorporated fine-tuning
models from the BERT family and open-source
LLMs, and conducting few-shot experiments
using closed-source LLMs. Our results, with
an F1-score of 62.69% (violation identification)
and 81.02% (associating victims), show that
our datasets and setups can be used for both
tasks. Finally, we publicly release the datasets
and the code used for the experiments in order
to advance further research in the area of legal
natural language processing (NLP).
